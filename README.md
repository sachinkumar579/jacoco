# jacoco

Spring boot project with a very basic utility file containing a method to add 2 numbers

The goal with this project is to explain how Unit tests can be written using testing
framework and how Jacoco plugin can be used to generate reports from these unit tests

Java version 1.8 ( Yeah because I am still living in the 90's)
Spring boot 2.5.3 (Yeah got the latest one there)
jacoco-maven-plugin 0.8.7 (Who cares) 

And thats it. Your Spring boot project with nice unit test reports will be up in seconds !
